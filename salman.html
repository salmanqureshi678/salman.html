        <h1>BABAR AZAM THE FINEST BATSMAN</h1>
        <li>Babar Azam is the only cricketer to score 5 consecutive centuries in a single country (United Arab
            Emirates). Babar is the fastest batsman to score 7, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 ODI centuries. With 17 centuries
            in ODIs he has the second most centuries in the format for a Pakistani batter.

        <li>In Test cricket, Kohli is far ahead of Babar in terms of the matches played and runs scored. He has scored
            8340 runs in 108 Tests, compared to Babar's 3696 runs in 47 Test matches. Although the batting averages of
            Virat and Babar are fairly similar, Virat has scored 19 more centuries than Babar.</li>

        <li>: A five-year-old boy, named Oscar, charmingly wrote an essay on Pakistan's Twenty20 International (T20I)
            captain Babar Azam — which was shared by the official Twitter account of Somerset County Cricket Club. Oscar
            met Babar after a medical surgery, last year, while the latter was playing for Somerset in the Vitality
            Blast. “Babar Azam is my favourite cricket player. He was born in Pakistan and he is 25 [years-old]. He is
            the best T20 batsman. He is the captain of Pakistan. He hits big sixes and one day I saw,” Oscar wrote. “He
            was very kind to me when I met him after my operation on feet last year,” the kid added. The number ranked
            T20I batsman in the world also appreciated this lovely gesture and was looking forward to seeing the kid
            again. “Hey Oscar, thank you so much for such a kind note. I am so proud of you buddy. You are a rockstar.
            Study hard and play even harder champ! Look forward to meet you,” Babar said while quoting the
            aforementioned tweet. Babar made a huge impact during his time at the Cooper Associates County Ground in
            2019. The 25-year-old was the leading run scorer in the 2019 Vitality Blast, amassing an incredible 578 runs
            at an average of 52.54. He struck a sublime 102 not out at the Ageas Bowl and boasted an impressive
            tournament strike rate of 149.35. His prowess with the bat saw him score one century and four half centuries
            from his 13 innings. He also struck 60 fours and 14 sixes during the competition.</li>

        <h2> INFORMATION ABOUT PAKISTAN</h2>
       <li> <P>The country I grew up in has always been dear to me. Pakistan is a Muslim republic that is situated in South Asia. The modern, multi-ethnic state of Pakistan was founded in 1947.

           The struggle for Pakistan was started when the Muslims of the sub-continent got harassed by the Indian government and were not getting their proper rights. Pakistani leader Sir Syed Ahmed Khan firstly used the word“Nation” for the Muslims. After his “Two Nation Theory” and Allama Iqbal's thought about a separate state in which Muslims can live according to Islamic teachings.
           
           The government is home to 28% of the world's total Hindu population and 20% of the Muslims. Pakistan is an Asian country and a federal republic. It is located in South Asia. As well as Islamabad, Pakistan has its most prominent city Karachi. It was established as a region on October 2nd, 1947, from the separation of India. Pakistan has a population of more than 200 million. </P>
